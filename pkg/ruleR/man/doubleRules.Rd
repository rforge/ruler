\description{
A list of basic \code{DoubleRule}s implemented in \code{ruleR}. 
Some functions use this list when (randomly) generating rules and tests.  Only the names of the rules are stored on the list. Changing \code{DoubleRules} changes the behaviour of \code{\link{createSR}},\code{\link{createDR}} and \code{\link{createTest}}
